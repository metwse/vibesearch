Why solve one of computer science's most fundamental problems with a boring,
efficient, and near-instant `.iter().position()`? That's so last century. 🙄

## Why vibesearch?
- 🦀 Peak Rust Safety: Written in 100% safe Rust because we
  `forbid(unsafe_code)`
- 🩸 Bleeding edge technology: Next-generation solution for finding an element
  in an array by asking a planet-sized AI model
- ™️ Blazingly Slow: Swap those pesky nanoseconds of local computation for
  hundreds of milliseconds of glorious network latency. Feel the weight of
  progress!
- 🏆 Featuring way 👋 too 2️⃣ many 🤯 emojis in the 📖 readme 💨

While the entire concept is fundamentally unreliable, at least you won't get a
segmentation fault. You're welcome. 🦀 🔥
